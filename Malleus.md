# Malleus

Malleus is a planet orbiting the main star of the solar system and, in this lore, the main planet of events.

## Time on Malleus

- Length of Day: 33 Hours
- 474 Days: 1 year
- Size: Exactly 2x the diameter of the Earth.
- Density: Exactly 2x that of Earth.
- Age: 3 billion Earth-years old.
- Location: 3rd from the main star.
- Atmosphere: Roughly Earth-like, around 20%~ more oxygen in the atmosphere are sea level.

Note that Malleus' orbit is elliptical and its axis tilts at 16 degrees. It has rings that cast a permanent shadow beneath them.

## Seasons

There are *five* seasons on Malleus. Four of them are familiar to us: a winter, a summer, a spring and a fall, but there is a fifth "season". This season occurs when habitable land passes beneath the planet's rings' shadows, creating an extended period of shade, allowing nocturnal entities and interdimensional creatures to roam free. 

## Life Formation:

Some life evolved naturally, others were seeded by God, others were hybrids of Gods, etc.
